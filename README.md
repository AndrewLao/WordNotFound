# WordNotFound

"WordNotFound" is a wordsearch Android application that consists of two gamemodes that features two games the user can play: a word search and a gravitational word search. 

The regular word search is the standard game where the user searches for words scattered throughout a field of letters. The words that the user searches for will be given in a word bank. The words will be made up of letters in a straight, adjacent line.

The gravitational word search will be similar to the regular word search, except the words that can be found won’t always be in a straight line. The board of letters will be created by having a set of words that will “drop onto each other.” As a result, the words will appear to be scrambled. The goal will be to find the original words.

Each gamemode consists of 5 levels, featuring a wordbank to keep track of your progress, a score for the word length that was found, a timer for how long the user has spent on the level, and a reset button to restart the level.

For the main gameplay, the user will press their finger down on the starting letter, drag their finger to the next letter, and repeat until they reach their desired final letter. Once the user lets go, the game will check if the user inputs' letters match a word in the wordbank. If it does, the wordbank crosses out the word and highlights the word on the main playing field.

After a level is finished, a result screen is shown that displays the score and amount of time spent. The user can then choose to either go back to the main menu (home button), retry the level, or go back to the respective level select screen.

The app also features a dark/light mode that can be toggled on and off in the "Settings" page. This setting will be saved even when the app is reset or re-opened.
